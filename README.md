A simple little game.
Doesn't do much yet.
You collect Easter eggs, when you've collected all eggs, you win.


Ideas for variations/improvements: 

- collect only eggs of one color
- create a random number of eggs
- let user enter a number of how many eggs to create 
- let user enter a number for the size of the field
- add arrow buttons so you can play without a keyboard
- set a countdown for the hunt
-- how many eggs collected until timeout?
-- or: lose if you don't collect all eggs before timeout!
- add a second player and take turns (you might want the second player to use WASD keys, you might also want to limit the amount of moves each player can make per round)
- create an 'enemy' that will make a random move whenever you move, if it hits and egg, it destroys it, if it hits you - game over! (more interesting in a small game field!)
- add levels with less time to collect eggs each round or more enemies each round etc.
